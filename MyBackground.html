            </h3>
            <p>I am a first-class graduate of the University of Benin, who studied Production Engineering with a CGPA of 4.55 out of 5.0 scale, with research, practical knowledge and experiences in welding and fabrication, solving world problems, and
              auto-mobile engineering. I have had internship experiences with companies where I got first level experience in mechanical and industrial engineering. I recently concluded my final year project in the area of solving trapezoidal fuzzy
              numbers using linear programming which can be applied in cutting cost in companies to the minimum and also managing of their financial resources, I didn’t stop there I went further in creating a visual basic software which can easily
              solve these trapezoidal fuzzy linear programming problem, this exposed me to a certain programming language called visual basic and also in the process of carrying out this project I gained further knowledge in carrying out optimization
              so as to minimize the use of time, the company`s resources, and maximize production. I`m also a self-driven person with excellent communication skills, keen on learning and acquiring new skills, and i'm able to do these things quickly and
              efficiently. I`m a person who love`s solving problems and have a great interest for math`s(calculation) and programming. I believe in team work (together everyone Achieves more). In addition
              i have also worked with various companies to hone my skills, and these companies include : <strong><em><a href="https://mandilasng.com/Homepage/index.html" target="_blank">mandilas enterprises limited warri</a></em> and <em>A & E
                  company</em></strong>. i have the basic skills of
              <strong>Automobile Engineering</strong>, <strong>welding & fabrication</strong> and <strong>web development</strong>.
